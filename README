Homeassistant ESPHome for ivt490/IVT495 and esp8266

Tested with d1_mini, but I guess it should work with most esp8266 boards?

Not much configuration needed, easiest is to use the RX pin (GPIO3) to attach to the TX port of the IVT heater.
Otherwise it might work to change the port in the yaml as well:
tx_pin: GPIO1
rx_pin: GPIO3
Both tx and rx have to be specified, even though tx is not used otherwise ESPHome wont activate the UART....
 
This code is based on https://github.com/stefanh12/IVT_490_esphome 
Further based on https://github.com/uabpra/ivt490 

Adapted to work without custom components and to work with ESPHome version >= 2026
